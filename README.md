Parallax eBadge Test Program in C

The parallax badge comes with a test program that exercises all of the devices contained in the unit.

This code was written in SPIN code and I wantted to try and write one in C as an alternative.

While there is a code library in C it does not resemble code that I would write.  It look more like what my cat would throw up.

Most of the code was converted to C using the SPIN to C converter program which generates C code but not what someone would write.
